<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>

<p>
    I'm starting to find more time for personal persuits now that our newborn son Brendan is sleeping more (he's four months old at the time of this writing).
    Here's what I'm up to (in no particular order):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Working at <a href="http://www.chariotsolutions.com" target="_blank">Chariot Solutions</a>, building full-stack enterprise software for our clients
        (<a href="http://chariotsolutions.com/who-we-are/careers/" target="_blank">We're hiring!</a>).
        My work of late has involved exploring the vast expanses of Scala, Akka and Spark.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spending as much time as possible with this crazy crew.  Hopefully some of it down the shore!

    </li>
    <li>
        Trying to finish <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses?from_search=true&search_version=service" target="_blank">Ulysses</a>
        for probably the third time.  I've got this lingering worry that I'll be hit by a bus and miss out on the fate of Leopold Bloom.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rewriting this site to experiment with <a href="http://www.semantic-ui.com" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Re-watching The West Wing as I follow along with <a href="http://thewestwingweekly.com/about/" target="_blank">The West Wing Weekly podcast</a>.
        Their commentary can feel a bit over-critical at times as they dissect which scenes work for them and which don't but the anecdotes and guests can be really interesting.
        For example, <a href="http://thewestwingweekly.com/episodes/110" target="_blank">Richard Schiff is the man.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Trying to resurrect <a href="http://www.datacombinator.com" target="_blank">DataCombinator</a> after some recent redesign.
        Hoping to get at least basic functionality restored so it can do more than simply host my Twitter bots.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing technical direction for my first startup, <a href="www.mainstreamintegration.com" target="_blank">Mainstream Integration</a>
    </li>
</ul>
