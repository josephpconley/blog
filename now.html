    <h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
    <small>Inspired by <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">Derek Sivers</a>.  Last updated November 7, 2016.</small>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Working at <a href="http://www.chariotsolutions.com" target="_blank">Chariot Solutions</a>, building full-stack enterprise software for our clients
            (<a href="http://chariotsolutions.com/who-we-are/careers/" target="_blank">We're hiring!</a>).
            Currently at Comcast doing Big Data work with Spark and Cassandra.

            Developing a steady cadence of reading, both for pleasure and education.
            I think I've settled on having one fiction book, one non-fiction book, and one topic/online course/etc. to focus on at a time.
            For example, I'm reading
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8488830-freedom?ac=1" target="_blank">"Freedom" by Daniel Suarez</a>,
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens?ac=1" target="_blank">"Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari</a>,
            and refreshing on Economics by reading <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Guides/TenKeyIdeas.html" target="_blank">Russ Roberts</a> and
            <a href="http://www.economicprinciples.org/" target="_blank">Ray Dalio</a>.
            I tried having more books to read at once but then it starts to feel too much like homework and my attention gets dispersed too thinly.
            Also taking notes using Evernote and <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/06/the-art-of-reading-how-to-read-a-book/" target="_blank">Shane Parrish's method of active reading</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Providing technical direction for a few different startups and business contacts.
            If you have any questions about software/data and how it applies to business, let me know!
        </li>
        <li>
            Limiting my consumption of social media, most notably Twitter on my phone, as it really hasn't added much value to my life.
            Apologies to Cal Newport as I probably won't quit entirely!
        </li>
        <li>
            Searching for interesting things to write about but haven't thought of much recently (definitely a LOTR article in the offing though), any suggestions?
        </li>
