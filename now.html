            Trying to develop a steady cadence of reading, both for pleasure and education.
            I think I've settled on having one fiction book, one non-fiction book, and one topic/online course/etc. to focus on at a time.
            For example, I'm reading "Freedom" by Daniel Suarez, "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari, and refreshing on Economics by reading Russ Roberts and Ray Dalio.
            I tried having more books to read at once but then it starts to feel too much like homework and my attention gets dispersed too thinly.

            Trying to think of interesting things to write about but haven't thought of much recently, any suggestions?
