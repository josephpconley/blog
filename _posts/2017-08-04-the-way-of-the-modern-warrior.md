Something I struggle with constantly is focus.  I've read books on productivity and deep work, yet still succumb to the quick gratifications of social media and daily news.  I try to focus my energies on one or two things, yet end up dispersing my energy towards several.  One day I've got a set strategy in my mind for what I want to achieve, and the next I continue to vascillate instead of committing to that one strategy.

None of this helps anyone, least of all myself.  And it's not to say I don't do good work.  It's just that I could be doing *more*.  Derek Sivers stresses the importance of the long-term view when he tells the parable of the donkey.  The donkey is equally hungry and thirsty, and equidistant from a bale of hay and a river.  Because he can't prioritize and make a choice, he dies.

As Neo says, "The problem is choice".  But the power to choose is one of our greatest superpowers.  We use it every day, every hour, every minute, and though we might not see the effects, each choice has long-term consequences.  Like in chaos theory, tiny variations can lead to large effects.  Yet I had been forcing myself to make too many decisions, with mixed results.

This was my state of mind when I happened upon "The Last Samurai" on cable.  One of my favorite movies, it depicts the story of an American solider in the late 1800s who gets captured in Japan by samurai in rebellion of the emperor, and comes to learn their way of life.  Few movies have resonated so strongly with me.  It shows the samurai way of life as that of discipline, focus, beauty, and service (the word samurai means "servant").

There's one scene in particular that was particularly relevant to my current plight.  The American is learning the way of the sword, but struggling.  One of his caretakers tells him, "Too many mind.  Mind of sword, mind of people watching, mind of enemy, too many mind!  No mind."  The American takes this advice to heart, and becomes a skilled swordsman.

Now, what's interesting is that the advice isn't "One mind", but "No mind".  To me, that means to stop overthinking and over-analyzing everything every minute of the day and just get lost in your work.  I think programmers especially know this feeling, where you're stuck on a problem and hours pass without you realizing it.  Some call it "flow"


My one hope for you (and myself) is that you find that small measure of peace that all of us seek, and few of us find.
