I found it difficult not to like Secretary Geithner after reading Stress Test.  He comes across as pragmatic, a realist who disdains the game of politics.  He's no stranger to profanity, yet is sincere when reflecting on his time spent away from his family as a public servant.  And he's clearly a very bright guy, rising fast in the world of finance despite a lack of formal training.  Yet his most endearing quality is his spirit for public service.   and its vital importance during a near-cataclysmic crisis.  These government officials sacrifice to serve the many, yet their efforts tend to be appreciated by the few. 

The Great Recession wiped away nearly $x trillion in personal wealth.  Unemployment shot as high as 10%, and we're still feeling the effects today.  Yet the average person probably doesn't appreciate that the crisis could've been significantly worse if not for "first responders" like Geithner, Ben Bernake and Hank Paulson.  This point is certainly debatable (what isn't in economics?), but the recent economic troubles of Europe highlight the dangers of excessive austerity and "Old Testament vengeance" (a Geithnerism) in times of crisis.  Our country largely avoided such a misstep, in no small part due to Geithner's experience in dealing with economic crises and Bernake's knowledge of the dynamics of the Great Depression.
  
Yet throughout the crisis and its aftermath, these public figures were vilified.  Populist rage demanded that bankers be hauled off to jail.  Any serious study of the Great Recession, however, shows that the crisis wasn't caused by corporate greed or insider trading, but a perfect storm of the housing bubble, complex financial instruments, and excessive leverage.  This underscores the dangers of only listening to popular sentiment.  It's important to try to get information from primary sources, not biased newspapers or shock jocks.  Otherwise you might think Geithner was a Goldman guy (he never was).             

I also consider Geithner to be an excellent teacher as he "marinates" (G) the reader in economic terminology.  He I wasn't surprised to learn he'd be co-teaching a course on the crisis on Coursera().  

##Further reading
- Too Big to Fail - great account of the crisis by Aaron Ross Sorkin (an equally good documentary done as well)
- Larry Summers' blog - he tends to give very thoughtful, if not highly intelligent, commentary on current issues in economics
