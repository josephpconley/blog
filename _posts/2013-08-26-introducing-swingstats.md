title: Introducing SwingStats!
excerpt: SwingStats is a free social golf network, built by and for golfers.  We built this application to solve two problems.
         Firstly, we wanted to help golfers to track their scores and maintain a valid handicap (without needing to belong to a country club).
         Secondly, we wanted to create a social network to allow golfers to connect and coordinate foursomes and golf outings.
         We believe providing these solutions helps golfers not only get better at golf but also enjoy the game as well.

<h3 class="golfUrl">Introducing SwingStats!</h3>

SwingStats is a free social golf network, built by and for golfers.  We built this application to solve two problems.
Firstly, we wanted to help golfers to track their scores and maintain a valid handicap (without needing to belong to a country club).
Secondly, we wanted to create a social network to allow golfers to connect and coordinate foursomes and golf outings.
We believe providing these solutions helps golfers not only get better at golf but also enjoy the game as well.

Our initial release is focused on providing functionality for any golfer to use.
Our next major release will focus on providing solutions to golf clubs and golf courses to help them manage their business.
We believe that scheduling tee times, running tournaments or outings, and managing promotions can be made simple and effective
when run on a platform that any golfer can sign up for and use for free.

But don't worry!  We'll continue to make improvements and updates to the application to give golfers the best experience possible.
That's why we value your feedback.  If you have any comments, questions, or feedback, feel free to
