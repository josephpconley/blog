Life in every breath.  That's a very appealing notion, especially during these increasingly distracted times.  It's one of those ideas that is [simple in theory but not easy in practice](andressen link).  While I love this scene and _The Last Samurai_ in general, I never felt like it was possible to live a life of discipline and devotion in today's world.  And yet I think one author offers a practical path to just that.

I started reading _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport over the past summer, thinking it'd be just like all of the other productivity books I'd read.  A guru lays out some rules based on his anecdotal experience.  Maybe his ideas will be relevant to my life and maybe they won't.  Hopefully he even livens up his advice with interesting personal stories.  Books like this are useful, but rather boring.  And yet there on the first couple of pages, I see a phrase that has rattled around my head the past few months, "I'll live the focused life, because it's the best life there is"().

Damn, I was not expecting that!  Productivity as a means to happiness?  Yet there it was, so succintly put.  The most interesting word in that quote is _best_.  It implies that out of all the possible ways you could try to live your life, simply being focused on what you're doing offers you the _best_ life.  It's also a very subjective word, it could mean successful, fulfilling, praiseworthy, really any virtue you find relevant.

I'm still searching for that deep work in my life.  Typical client constraints force me to have long commutes and noisy workspaces.  Also, as an hourly consultant, the payoffs for being more efficient are a bit minimized.  I could be the most efficient developer in the company, I'd still have to put in my 40 hours.

I think our era needs more thinkers like Newport.  "I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways are joined the new".
