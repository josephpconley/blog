This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at Chariot Day 2017, an internal conference put on by
my fellow Charioteers.  This is the third I've attended, and I was amazed by the impressive breadth and depth of the
talks.  I feel very lucky to be working with people much smarter than me!

I gave a talk on how to use Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin to provide quick SQL-based visualizations for your personal finances.
Here are the slides if you're interested.  I'll be delving more into notebooks and developer productivity in a later post.
I'm working on exposing the Zeppelin notebooks that were part of the demo as well, if you're interested in running the notebooks
against your own personal finance dataset let me know!
