Do you build reactive applications using Scala?  Then chances are you've had to deal with a `Future[Monad[T]]`, where `Monad` could be `Option`, `Either`, or something [more wonderful](http://www.josephpconley.com/2016/07/18/an-ode-to-or.html) like `Or`.  While these monads do nest as expected, the syntax and code flow can start to get pretty messy (motivating example below).

Enter [FutureOr](https://github.com/chariotsolutions/scala-commons#futureor)!  This utility makes it super-simple to sequence several `Future[Or[T]]` calls.  It's also fairly easy to implement, so you could easily clone this and customize for your favorite nested monad combination.

```
//three service calls which return Future[Or[T]] and depend on the previous call
trait IntService{
  def callA: Future[Int Or One[ErrorMessage]]
  def callB(int a): Future[Int Or One[ErrorMessage]]
  def callC(int b): Future[Int Or One[ErrorMessage]]
}
val service: IntService = ...

//without FutureOr, really ugly!  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
val result: Future[Int Or One[ErrorMessage]] = 
     service.callA.flatMap{ a =>
          a.flatMap{
               case Good(goodA) => service.callB(goodA).flatMap { b =>
                    b.flatMap {
                         case Good(goodB) => service.callC(goodB)
                         case Bad(e) => Future.successful(Bad(e))
                    }
               }
               case Bad(e) => Future.successful(Bad(e))
          }
     }


//with FutureOr, so much better!
val result: Future[Int Or One[ErrorMessage]] =
     (for {
          a <- FutureOr(service.callA)
          b <- FutureOr(service.callB(a))
          c <- FutureOr(service.callC(b)
     } yield c).future
```
