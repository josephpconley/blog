title: Hello World
excerpt: SwingStats is a free social golf network, built by and for golfers.  We built this application to solve two problems.
         Firstly, we wanted to help golfers to track their scores and maintain a valid handicap (without needing to belong to a country club).
         Secondly, we wanted to create a social network to allow golfers to connect and coordinate foursomes and golf outings.
         We believe providing these solutions helps golfers not only get better at golf but also enjoy the game as well.
