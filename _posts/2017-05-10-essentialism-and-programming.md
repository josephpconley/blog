Writing code is the same way.  A good codebase should be *as close to reality as possible* with no extraneous noise or ceremony.
As I was reminded by Jessica Kerr ([@jessitron](http://www.twitter.com/jessitron)) recently at [ETE](http://2017.phillyemergingtech.com/),
code *is* documentation.  
  
Writing in general is the same way.  Even as I write this post, I'm removing supurfulous adjectives to make my arguments
as short and concise as possible.  Brevity is the soul of wit!
