I've recently become enamored of [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org).  His personality and worldview seem eerily consistent with mine.  I've recently learned that he started the custom of hosting a "/now" page on his website which gives a [brief description](http://nownownow.com/about) of what he's doing at the moment.  I love that idea!  The inherent simplicity stands in stark contrast to the information overload of your typical social media platform.  It also forces you to take stock of what you're doing and where you want to go.
  
  So if you're ever curious about what I'm doing, just go to [/now](/now).
