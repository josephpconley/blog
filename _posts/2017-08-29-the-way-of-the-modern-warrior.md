Something I struggle with constantly is focus.  I've read books on productivity and deep work, yet still succumb to the quick gratifications of social media and daily news.  I try to focus my energies on one or two things, yet end up dispersing my energy towards several.  One day I've got a set strategy in my mind for what I want to achieve, and the next I waver on my commitments and re-think my strategy.

None of this helps anyone, least of all myself.  And it's not to say I don't do good work.  It's just that I could be doing *more*.  [Derek Sivers]() stresses the importance of the long-term view when he tells the parable of the donkey.  The donkey is equally hungry and thirsty, and equidistant from a bale of hay and a river.  But because he can't prioritize and make a choice, he stays put and eventually dies.

As Neo says, "The problem is choice".  The power to choose is one of our greatest superpowers.  We use it every day, every hour, every minute, and though we might not see the effects immediately, each choice has long-term consequences.  Like in chaos theory, tiny variations can lead to large effects.  Which is why I've had this feeling lately that my donkeying was holding me back.

Then one day I randomly saw "The Last Samurai" on cable.  One of my favorite movies, it depicts the story of an American solider and military trainer in the late 1800s who gets captured in Japan by samurai in rebellion of the emperor, and comes to learn their way of life.  He observes how the samurai perform their daily tasks like pouring a cup of tea with complete focus and discipline.  He comes to learn about "bushido", the philosophy that we are all dying and we need to be aware of "life in every breath".

Few movies have resonated so strongly with me.  The acting is excellent, and Hans Zimmer's musical score is unmatched.  Yet there's one scene that was particularly relevant to my current plight.  The American is learning the way of the sword, but struggling.  One of his caretakers admonishes him, "Too many mind!  Mind of sword, mind of people watching, mind of enemy, too many mind!  No mind."  The American takes this advice to heart, and eventually becomes a skilled swordsman.

Now what's interesting to me is that the advice isn't "One mind", but "No mind".  I've thought about that a lot, and for me I think it means to stop worrying about my own feelings or self-perception and just get lost in whatever I'm doing in the present.  Given my career goals (I'd like to be a CTO or CEO some day), I think managing a dozen different tasks on a daily basis is unavoidable.  We can, however, manage how mindfully we engage with these tasks, and manage our emotions as well.

This "no mind" approach can also help you enter a state of "flow".  I think programmers especially know this feeling, where you're fully engaged with a problem and hours pass without you realizing it.  Or your 


My one hope for you (and myself) is that you find that small measure of peace that all of us seek, and few of us find.
