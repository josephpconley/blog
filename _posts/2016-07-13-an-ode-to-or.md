> How do I love [Or](http://www.scalactic.org/user_guide/OrAndEvery)?  Let me [Accumulate](http://doc.scalatest.org/2.2.6/#org.scalactic.Accumulation) the ways.\\
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height\\
My IDE can reach, when feeling uncompiled\\
For the Ends of Being and ideal control flow.\\
I love thee to the level of every day's\\
Most quiet need, a quiet workspace and thorough documentation.\\
I love thee freely, as my functions strive for [Good](http://doc.scalatest.org/2.2.6/#org.scalactic.Good).\\
I love thee purely, as they capture errors with [Bad](http://doc.scalatest.org/2.2.6/#org.scalactic.Bad).\\
I love thee with the passion put to use\\
In my old griefs with [Either](http://danielwestheide.com/blog/2013/01/02/the-neophytes-guide-to-scala-part-7-the-either-type.html), and with my childhood's faith.\\
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\\
With my lost saints of Java! – I love thee with the breath,\\
Smiles, tears, of all my past programs! – and, if [Venners](https://twitter.com/bvenners) choose,\\
I shall but love thee better after sys.exit(0).
