Don't read this book for the narrative.  It starts out kind of interesting.  The protagonist, John Daily (unfortunately NOT the golfer) has a typical life with typical problems.  Deals with union problems at work and inattentiveness at home.  Yet he has these recurring dreams about a character named Simeon.  OK, I'm interested so far.  But the only payoff here is that the businessman turned monk that he seeks advice from took the name Simeon.  Cute coincidence, but nothing more meaningful or interesting.

The interactions in the group meetings feels extremely contrived.  The characters lack depth, each seemingly created to serve as a typical stereotype to keep the dialogue moving in a specific direction.

OK, complaints out of the way.  I really enjoyed the principles espoused in this book.  As with all good ideas, it felt like familiar notions presented in new ways.  Here are a few of my favorites

## Power vs. Authority
The author draws an interesting distinction between power, forcing others to do your will, and authority, having others willingly do your will.  He encourages a reflection of what figures in your life have authority over you and what traits such a figure has.  My mind immediately went to Elon Musk, and I listed a few of his traits as

- Ambitious
- Brave
- Pragmatic

The characters in the book discuss other traits like listening, respectfulness, and encouragement.  What's interesting is that all of these traits are _behaviors_, not some innate talent that we might have or lack.  Very encouraging!

## Intentions vs. Actions
I especially enjoyed the distinction between intentions and actions.  I have a tendency to get too passive, reading a lot but not actually _doing_ anything with my knowledge.  So the following two equations really resonated with me:

```
INTENTIONS - ACTIONS = SQUAT
INTENTIONS + ACTIONS = WILL
```

As GRRM says in _Game of Thrones_, "words are wind".  It's more important to pay attention to what people do, not what they say.  I thought this went nicely with the author's definition of *humility* as being authentic.  

## Happiness vs. Joy
This was probably one of the more meaningful ideas in the book.  He draws the contrast of happiness as being dependent on things outside of our control (i.e. happenstance).  I found money on the street, I'm happy.  I got cut off while driving, I'm not.  This is more superficial compared to joy, which he defines as the inner satisfaction that one is truly aligned with the direction of their life.  This goes much deeper and doesn't waver based on external influence.

He also touches on this idea when describing love as _behavior_ and not feeling.  When we first fall in love, what we initially would describe as feelings of love are mostly infatuation.  True love (agape) is serving the object of your love.

# Servant
Good live is a live of service.


# Conclusion
Good ideas here despite the clumsy storytelling!

I'm reminded of an Ignatian prayer that I learned at The University of Scranton that very succinctly sums up this book:

```
Eternal Word, only begotten Son of God,
Teach me true generosity
Teach me to serve you as you deserve
To give without counting the cost
To fight without seeking rest
To sacrifice myself for you without any reward
Save the knowledge that I have done your will.
```
