The 2014 PGA Championship at Valhalla starts tomorrow amid several interesting storylines.  Will Tiger be healthy enough to play (and if so, will he tell us before countless fantasy drafts ensue)?  Will Rory continue his dominance and retain his World Number 1 status, or will Adam Scott parlay his strong performance in majors to regain the top spot?  Or will a past champion like Padraig Harrington or Y.E. Yang reclaim Glory's Last Shot?

As a participant (and administrator) of a Golf Majors pool, I like to know the [world rankings and betting odds for the field](http://www.swingstats.com/draft)) to help inform the draft and facilitate automated picks.  For this last major, I also wanted to know how the field has performed in this year's prior majors.  Here's what I've found:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Player</th>
			<th>The Masters</th>
			<th>U.S. Open</th>
			<th>British Open</th>
		</tr>			
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

No real surprises here.

Ultimately, there's no one metric that can predict
