In Aaron Sorkin's masterpiece *The West Wing*, there's one particularly good episode ("Let Bartlet Be Bartlet") where President Bartlet is struggling to stay energized throughout the day.  Here's Part One:

While Bartlet's aide quips that his mood is a dietary issue, we soon find out over the course of the episode that the root cause might be deeper.  Bartlet's directed his staff to make soft attempts at aggressive reforms ("dangle your feet"), but deep down it's clear that Bartlet's ultimately playing it safe so he can get re-elected.  This comes to a head in the beautifully-acted climax of the episode:

Quite the motivational scene!  But I want to focus on one aspect, risk.  It's clear that Bartlet's timidity stems from his desire to be a two-term president.  He's assuming that getting aggressive on reform will alienate too many people and cost him re-election.  Even if that were true (which is debatable), is it worth feeling the way he feels?  Lacking energy at the end of each day?  What's the point in getting what you want if you don't feel fulfilled along the way?

I imagine most of us feel like this at one time or another (I sure have).  Feeling like we're playing it safe, trying to maintain the status quo rather than take a risk.  But what is risk?  Is it really that risky to start your own company?  Or go back to school to pursue what truly interests you?  There's risk and then there's *existential risk*.  Is it worth it to stay in neutral and live relatively comfortable lives, or should we take on more perceived risk?

Not easy questions to answer, so what should our first steps be?
