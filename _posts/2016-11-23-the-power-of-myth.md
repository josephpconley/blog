Perspective.  That was my biggest takeaway from reading _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_ by Yuval Noah Harari.  He does a masterful job in articulating the history of our species and the forces that guided the creation of our culture.  He really forces you to reflect on your own role in the universe, and try to understand what's meaningful and what isn't.

Harari touches on a few dozen or so fields of study throughout his book like history, biology, economics, philosophy, political science, and computer science to name a few.  I was amazed to learn that there were multiple different human species,and that ours won out mostly due to the creation of fictions/myths.  Turns out that the companies we work for and the money we earn are fictions too, which is alarming but undeniable.

I think I most appreciated the power that the individual has in our current age.  We've advanced technologically by leaps and bounds.  And as most dystopian books or movies will tell you, with that great power comes a great responsibility.  Climate change is real folks.  We have not been very hospitable guests of this planet, exterminating entire species of animal wholesale and polluting our environment.

This is a great read for people from all walks of life, a great reminder of where we come from, where we've been and where we could be going.  We're more empowered than ever in this technological age to shape the direction of our species.  Pretty cool!
