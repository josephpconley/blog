I've recently become enamored of [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org).  His personality and worldview seem eerily consistent with mine.  I've recently learned that he pioneered a "/now" movement, where the author uses the /now page of their site to give readers a [brief description](http://nownownow.com/about) of what "this person is focused on at this stage in their life".  I love that idea!  This concept creates a space for a simple, static update that won't get lost in the chaos of a social media platform.  It encourages you to have creative control over content (we're coding in pure HTML here, not constrained by an application).  It also forces you to take stock of your current goals and decide what's important and what's not.  Great habits all!  I hope to check back with my /now page every so often to see where I've been and figure out where I want to go. 
  
So if you're ever curious about what I'm doing, just go to [/now](/now).
