Chariot Solutions recently hosted their 9th annual Chariot Day, an internal tech conference where the members of Chariot Solutions give tech talks to their Chariot peers.  I love the idea of an internal tech conference.  It's especially relevant for us as consultants given the inherently fractured nature of our work where everyone is partitioned into client teams.  A conference like this helps us to reconnect and lets new additions like me get to know my co-workers.

I was impressed by the volume and scope of the presentations.  There were two high-quality, concurrent tracks of talks from which to choose.  Choosing which talk to attend grew more difficult as the day progressed, and I found myself wishing for the quantum superposition necessary to see both talks at once.  The variety of topics was also impressive.  There were talks that I found directly relevant to my day-to-day work, like discussions on new language features, advanced Git usage, and architecture concepts like REST and Microservices.  However, there were also talks that were just plain interesting, like hardware hacks to prevent robocallers, 3D-printing tutorials, and native microcontroller development.  What also made these talks enjoyable was the congenial atmosphere.  Discussions were more conversational than pedantic, and the speakers were happy to let the audience drive the conversation.

The conference also carried a very light-hearted tone, helped in part by the ample stores of food and alcohol.  The final "Double Hyper Secret Bonus Talk HD Plus+" was revealed to be a workshop on how to roll cigars, a craft for which I now have a much greater appreciation.  The day concluded with a happy hour and quizzo game, the latter of which was, in true tech fashion, conducted using a Meteor app and web-based responses.  Our mascot even crashed the party as well (Tom Purcell was mysteriously absent for this part).

I think internal conferences and workshops are a great way to not only share knowledge but encourage team building.  They are also a welcome respite from the repetitive cadence of our typical workweeks and serve as a good reminder about why we wanted to work with technology in the first place (for the free beer, of course).  It is also a lot of work to plan and coordinate, so a special thanks to the Chariot Day committee for putting this together!

Looking forward to next year!
