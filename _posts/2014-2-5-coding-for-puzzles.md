I'm a big fan of puzzles.  In addition to the jumble and crossword in the paper, I religiously listen to NPR's Weekly Puzzle featuring Will Shortz.  At the end of each segment, he poses a question to the audience, and sometimes, these questions can be solved by programming.  To that end, I've built a basic tool to help solve some of these puzzles, and other similar tasks like an anagram solver and a Scrabble search.

The full library I've built for solving puzzles (in Scala) can be found [here](https://github.com/josephpconley/scala/tree/master/puzzles).  In addition to puzzle utilities, this project also has an npr package which shows examples of programs written to solve NPR puzzles.
