I recently attended the first annual [The Data Science Conference](http://www.thedatascienceconference.com) in downtown Chicago.  The unique selling point was the promise of a" vendor-free, sponsor-free, and recruiter-free" experience, a promise which held true to an almost comical level (try talking about data science and not saying Hadoop or Spark).  The conference drew practitioners and academics from all walks of life, representing the auto insurance, retail, and finance industries.  The big technology companies in data science were also represented with speakers from Google, IBM, and Microsoft delivering interesting talks.

One recurring theme throughout the conference was the idea of "breadth vs. depth".  Any endeavor in data science tends to demand a variety of technical, analytical, and theoretical knowledge, and this idea was proven out in talks reviewing the state of data science education (both in university and online).  I was also astounded by the sheer breadth of applications that were discussed.  Simple ideas like planning employee meetings efficiently, analyzing PC game reviews, and flight paths of drones were fodder for the data science cannons.

The inevitable "What is a Data Scientist?" discussion arose as well.  I didn't find such discussions that interesting, mostly because I'm a programmer by trade and haven't done much data science work (yet). Ultimately the most insightful definition was "I know one when I see one".

The absence of sponsors coupled with the small conference size led to a very collegial atmosphere.  The wide diversity of backgrounds, skill levels, and work environments led to interesting conversation.  My chats ranged from analyzing fantasy football to solving probability puzzlers.

As a newcomer to data science, I found the conference to be a good introduction to the field.  As I'm finishing [Andrew Ng](http://www.twitter.com/AndrewYNg)'s most excellent [Machine Learning](http://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home) course, I think I'll be diving deep into some more technical aspects of data science, specifically with Apache Spark.  Special thanks to [Chariot Solutions](http://chariotsolutions.com/) for sponsoring my trip!
