I was recently featured in an article discussing how CTO's manage remote teams.  It's certainly a non-trivial task, 
but an increasingly relevant one as software teams become more and more geographically distributed.  I think this 
a great trend, as your potential resource pool becomes much wider once you look beyond your backyard.  
I've certainly been blessed to have found such strong talent to work with at Buyside, both locally and remotely,
and our company is the better for it.

Enjoy!
