    <p>
        Dear Recruiters,
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm posting my resume here for reference.
        I have a few e-mail filters which (hopefully) filter out any cold recruiting e-mails from my inbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really really really don't like getting cold calls from a recruiter.  They almost always happen right when
        I'm in the middle of writing code or trying valiantly to enter some "deep work" state.
        Consequently, any such cold calls will be met with general rudeness or outright hostility depending on my mood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks in advance for your consideration!
    </p>
