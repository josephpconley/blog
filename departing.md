# Departing Words

Life is short.  Cliche, but true.  With the knowledge that I could drop dead tomorrow, and casting aside the typical 
but important concerns of financial planning and the like, I wanted to take the time to bequeath
to anyone who's interested (hopefully my kids at least) some of my thoughts.  More specifically, these are ideas
which may or may not be unique to me, ideas they might not otherwise hear in my absence.

## Philosophy Matters

I doubt you'd see this advice on social media.  But philosophy does matter.  And it's hard.  Reading Aristotle, Marx, Kant aren't easy, quick, or 
fun pursuits.  But you'll be better off for it.  Trying to understand and appreciate philosophy is most likely something
you won't be able to do on your own, so seek out teachers who have trodden these paths and can give you direction.
  
And yes I know there isn't much of a job market for philosophers outside of academia.  I'm not saying make a life's work out of
 it and go live in the woods.  I am saying that philosophy _challenges_ us.  It challenges our view of the world, how we think,
 how we act, and how we use language.  What could be a more fundamental field of study than that?  What could equip you better
 for a life in a world of constant change and uncertainty?  You've got your whole lives to learn the ins and outs of business,
 my advice for college is take one or two philosophy courses, you might find a whole new you
